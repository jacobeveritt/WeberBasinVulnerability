# Weber Basin Vulnerability Study

  Working with the Utah Division of Water Resources' RiverWare Model, Utah State University (USU) has developed a cliamte vulnerability study for the Weber Basin Conservancy District. 
  USU is using a bottom-up approach (Brown et al. 2012) wherein we assess sensitivity of the Weber Basin water system 
  to scenarios of future streamflow (6), demands (6), reservoir sedimentation (3), and reservoir evaporation rate (3). 
  In all, 324 model runs (6x6x3x3), each of 30 year length at monthly timestep, are made and results are reported for two main indicators:
  
  1) Fraction of years the total reservoir storage for the system falls below 280,000, 320,000, and 380,000 acre-feet which are the
  Extreme, Severe, and Moderate levels defined in the Weber Basin's Drought Contingency Plan.
  2) Shortages to 20 service areas.
  
  Results are primary presented as countour plots for different combinations of demand (x-axis) and inflow (y-axis) scenarios.
