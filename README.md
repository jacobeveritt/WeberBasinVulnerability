# Weber Basin Vulnerability Study

  Working with the Utah Division of Water Resources' RiverWare Model, Utah State University (USU) has developed a cliamte vulnerability study for the Weber Basin Conservancy District. 
  USU is using a bottom-up approach (Brown et al. 2012) wherein we assess sensitivity of the Weber Basin water system 
  to scenarios of future streamflow (6), demands (6), reservoir sedimentation (3), and reservoir evaporation rate (3). 
  In all, 324 model runs (6x6x3x3), each of 30 year length at monthly timestep, are made and results are reported for two main indicators:
  
  1) Fraction of years the total reservoir storage for the system falls below 280,000, 320,000, and 380,000 acre-feet which are the
  Extreme, Severe, and Moderate levels defined in the Weber Basin's Drought Contingency Plan.
  2) Shortages to 20 service areas.
  
  Results are primary presented as countour plots for different combinations of demand (x-axis) and inflow (y-axis) scenarios.

# Scenario Factors

## Inputs

### Climate
* Reservoir Evaporation
  ** 3.2 FT/YR
  ** 3.7 FT/YR
  ** 4.0 FT/YR
  
* Landscape Evapotranspiration
  ** % Change from the UofU Climate study
  
### Streamflow

* Low flows identified from the reconstructed droughts of the paleo record (dating back to 1430 AD), and low flows identified from the 100 years of observed flows. (The flows are selected by 
  
### Demographic

* Population changes --Population projections are from University of Utah's Kem C. Gardener Population projections, and projections form the Weber Basin Conservancy District (~~**20?? Report?**~~). By County

  * Population Years Used 
  
     - 2015 Population
     - 2070 Population
     - 2150 Population

### Demand

* Per Capita Demand Projections -- by County (Secondary and Culinary Water Demands)
 - ***Current*** Per Capita Water Use.
 - ***Decreased*** Per Capita Water Use; Set to match the 2025 goal of 25% Per Capita reduction.
 - ***Drastic Decrease*** Per Capita Water Use; Aribitrary 40% to see see the extent of *drastic* water demand reduction.

* Agricultural Conversion

### Other factors

* Sedimentation of Reservoirs


### Operational  (Future work that could be done, but not yet included)

* Usage restrictions: The where and when to shut off water supply in case of extreme water shortage (*Drought Contingency Plan*)

* New Reservoirs

* Additional Operation changes


# RiverWare Simulation

The UDWR has developed a model for the Weber Basin Conservancy District using RiverWare. RiverWare is an interactive tool developed by CADWES used for water system analysis.
