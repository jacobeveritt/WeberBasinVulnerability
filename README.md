# Weber Basin Vulnerability Study

  Working with the Utah Division of Water Resources' RiverWare Model, Utah State University (USU) has developed a drought vulnerability study for the Weber Basin Conservancy District. USU is using a bottom-up approach (Brown et al.2012) to assess vulnerability of the Districtâ€™s water system to climate, streamflow, demographic, operational, and other factors identified. The goal is to develop 60 scenarios that represent combinations of the factors and the factor levels which have been identified. Sixty scenarios represent the number of scenarios that is tractable to simulate and analyze

# Scenario Factors

## Inputs

### Climate
* Reservoir Evaporation
  ** 3.2 FT/YR
  ** 3.7 FT/YR
  ** 4.0 FT/YR
  
* Landscape Evapotranspiration
  ** % Change from the UofU Climate study
  
### Streamflow

* Low flows identified from the reconstructed droughts of the paleo record (dating back to 1430 AD), and low flows identified from the 100 years of observed flows. (The flows are selected by 
  
### Demographic

* Population changes --Population projections are from University of Utah's Kem C. Gardener Population projections, and projections form the Weber Basin Conservancy District (~~**20?? Report?**~~). By County

  * Population Years Used 
  
     - 2015 Population
     - 2070 Population
     - 2150 Population

### Demand

* Per Capita Demand Projections -- by County (Secondary and Culinary Water Demands)
 - ***Current*** Per Capita Water Use.
 - ***Decreased*** Per Capita Water Use; Set to match the 2025 goal of 25% Per Capita reduction.
 - ***Drastic Decrease*** Per Capita Water Use; Aribitrary 40% to see see the extent of *drastic* water demand reduction.

* Agricultural Conversion

### Other factors

* Sedimentation of Reservoirs


### Operational  (Future work that could be done, but not yet included)

* Usage restrictions: The where and when to shut off water supply in case of extreme water shortage (*Drought Contingency Plan*)

* New Reservoirs

* Additional Operation changes


# RiverWare Simulation

The UDWR has developed a model for the Weber Basin Conservancy District using RiverWare. RiverWare is an interactive tool developed by CADWES used for water system analysis.
