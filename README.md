# Weber Basin Cliamte Vulnerability Study - Bottom-Up Analysis

  Working with the Utah Division of Water Resources (UDWR), University of Utah, Western Water Assessment, and the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District, 
  Utah State University (USU) is using a bottom-up approach (Brown et al.2012) to assess vulnerability of the Districtâ€™s water system to future uncertain streamflow, water demands, reservoir sedimentation, 
  and reservoir evaporation conditions. 
  USU has developed 3 to 6 scenarios of possible future conditions for each streamflow, water demand, reservoir sedimination, and reservoir evaporation factor. Each scenario is defined by R preprocessing scripts
  and read into the UDWR's Riverware model for the Weber Basin. Then, the RiverSmart tool was used to simulate all combinations of future streamflow, water demand, and reservoir sedimination scenarios.
  R post processing scripts are used to aggregate, synthesize, and visualize results to show the conditions for which the District's total reservoir storage will fall below storage drought contingency plan 
  targets or there will be shortage to users.
  
  The repository folders are organized as follows
  * 0 - Code: All R code used in preprocessing and postprocessing steps. Files are numbered in the order they should be run
  * 1 - Scenario Processing: Streamflow, Demand, and Evaporation subfolders with data used to define the scenarios
  * 2 - RiverWare Modeling: Model, rules, hydrology, demands, and other file and folder system setup generated by Riverware. The Scenario folder contains output files of total shortages and total reservoir storage for each model run (e.g., Trace1,Trace1,Trace1 = Demand Scenario 1, Inflow Scenario 1, Sedimentation Scenario 1)
         [[[NEED MORE COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF Subfolders]]]]
  * 3 - Post Processing: [[NEEDS UPDATE]]
  
Software requirements: R Studio, Riverware, Riversmart
Hardware requirements: PC/Windows (to run Riverware)
Reproducibility Level: The intent of this repository is to provide all the data and code for a user to reproduce the final synthesis results. The user will need a Riverware software license
 to run Riverware and Riversmart (https://riverware.org/riverware/LicensingRW/). All Riverware and Riversmart results are provided for users who do not have a license.

# Scenario Factors

## Inputs

### Climate
* Reservoir Evaporation
* Reservoir Precipitation
* Landscape Evapotranspiration

### Streamflow

* Low flows identified from the reconstructed droughts of the paleo record (dating back to 1430 AD), and low flows identified from the 100 years of observed flows. (The flows are selected by 
  
### Demographic

* Population changes --Population projections are from University of Utah's Kem C. Gardener Population projections, and projections form the Weber Basin Conservancy District (~~**20?? Report?**~~). By County

  * Population Years Used 
  
     - 2015 Population
     - 2070 Population
     - 2150 Population

### Per Capita Demand

* Per Capita Demand Projections are from the Weber Basin Conservancy Districts (~~**20?? Report?**~~). By County
 - ***Current*** Per Capita Water Use.
 - ***Decreased*** Per Capita Water Use; Set to match the 2025 goal of 25% Per Capita reduction.
 - ***Drastic Decrease*** Per Capita Water Use; Aribitrary 40% to see see the extent of *drastic* water demand reduction.

### Operational

* Usage restrictions: The where and when to shut off water supply in case of extreme water shortage (*Drought Contingency Plan*)

* New Reservoirs

* Additional Operation changes

### Other factors

* Sedimentation of Reservoirs

* Agricultural Conversion

# RiverWare Simulation

The UDWR has developed a model for the Weber Basin Conservancy District using RiverWare. RiverWare is an interactive tool developed by CADWES used for water system analysis.
